File includes 2 of my projects,
1. Restaurant recommender : Takes sorted data from file and stores its info, upon user inputting his/her preference it will recommend restaurant. This is a simple implementation and can be made complex by
   taking live data from user (eg his location) and restaurant (eg available reservation) and put into real life use
2. Telephone route : A data structure project which uses dijkstra algo for calculation of shortest route between a graph like connection for telephone network
